# LLM Function Calling
A small project to study LLM Function Calling. The main objective of this project is to explore the concept of real-time question and response. The idea is to create a system where users can ask questions and receive immediate answers. For instance, users can inquire about the current temperature or check the stock prices in Vietnam.

By implementing LLM Function Calling, we aim to provide a seamless and efficient experience for users seeking real-time information. This project serves as a learning opportunity to understand the intricacies of handling real-time queries and delivering prompt responses.
